# Talk Title

What does my Operating System Sound Like? Let's Sonify System Calls!

What Sound Does An Operating System Make?!!

# Abstract for your talk

Computers are quiet. So quiet, you can't tell what they're thinking!

Lets construct a digital stethoscope to amplify the inner workings of our computer, and see what we can hear!

I want to talk to you about system calls, sonification, and how "strange translations" can enrich our understanding of the world.

# Timeline for your talk

1.
In the first minute, I will introduce myself and make some sort of deadpan joke.
1.
Next, I will talk about machines that people relate to and understand through the sounds they make, like a car, or a typewriter.

2 minutes:
I'll then talk a little bit about old computers and the noises they made. Once upon a time, you could debug your mainframe by ear!
I'll walk briefly through 70 years of computer machinery becoming more solid-state, and how their noises have disappeared one by one (transistors, hard drives, even fans!).

2 minutes:
Next, I'll talk about the rough structure of an operating system:
The kernel, the "application space", and the system call layer between them.

I'll introduce `strace` and show how it can observe and filter system call events in real time. I'll show the signals going by as text.

2 minutes:
I'll talk about how I thought about what these should sound like, explaining my design ethic

I want to make a larger point here, about the human brain and the range of human senses, and that computer interfaces that engage all of our senses are more comfortable and fit into our lives in more holistic ways.

I'll run some common programs that make a lot of system calls, and make a little racket.
(don't worry, I'll practice this demo and have a backup plan!)

At the end of the talk, I want to take two minutes to point out the value of useless ideas like this, that give

Humans have many senses and emotions that don't traditionally fit inside our model of computing, and that impoverishes our relationship to computers.

# Intended Audience

(Note: My demo is sound-based, and some of the points that I make will be through allusions to different sounds. This talk may be less interesting to a person with hearing loss, but I will at the very least avoid language that's unnecessarily alienating) 

I have two main ideas I want to cover with the audience:

The first is an understanding of what a syscall is, contextualized to everyday computing tasks. I won't expect people to already know about systems programming or operating system theory. Even if people already know what a syscall is, I want to give them a new form of intuition about them.


The second idea is a general appreciation for the computer as a system that can be observed and understood from multiple perspectives. 

This should be interested to anyone interested in perception, cognition, and humans' relationships towards their tools and towards their senses!

I think the "strange translation" of an invisible system into an audible one allows us to relate to computers in new and enriching ways.

Cognition connected to perception, can't be separated.
