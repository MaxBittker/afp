# Talk Title

Listening to the Computer: Let's Sonify System Calls!

What does an Operating System _Sound_ Like??!

# Abstract for your talk

Computers these days are so quiet, you can't tell what they're thinking!

Lets take a digital stethoscope to the internal workings of the machine, and listen to what we can hear there.

I want to talk to you about what computers used to sound like, and show you how we can still listen in on our operating systems by making system calls audible.

Let's talk about what your operating system looks like, and how they might sound.

# Timeline for your talk

1minute:
In the first minute, I will introduce myself and make a funny deadpan joke.

1 minute:
Then, I will talk about some machines that humans relate to through their sounds, like cars or type writers.

2 minutes:
I'll then talk a little bit about old computers and the noises they made. Once upon a time, you could debug your mainframe by ear!
I'll walk briefly through 70 years of computer machinery becoming more solid-state, and how their noises have disappeared one by one (transistors, hard drives, even fans!).

2 minutes:
Next, I'll talk about the rough structure of an operating system:
The kernel, the "application space", and the system call layer between them.

I'll introduce `strace` and show how it can observe and filter system call events in real time. I'll show the signals going by as text.

2 minutes:
I'll talk about how I thought about what these should sound like, and make connections to other complex machinery.

I want to make a larger point here, about the human brain and the range of human senses, and that computer interfaces that engage all of our senses are more comfortable and fit into our lives in more holistic ways.

I'll run some common programs that make a lot of system calls, and make a little racket.
(don't worry, I'll practice this demo and have a backup plan!)

At the end of the talk, I want to take two minutes to point out the value of useless ideas like this, that give

Humans have many senses and emotions that don't traditionally fit inside our model of computing, and that impoverishes our relationship to computers.

# Intended Audience

I have two main ideas I want to impart to the audience.

The first is an understanding of what a syscall is, contextualized to everyday computing tasks.

The second idea is an appreciation for the computer as a physical machine that can be observed and understood on multiple levels.

I think the "strange translation" of an invisible system into an audible one allows us to relate to computers in new and enriching ways.

Cognition connected to perception, can't be seperated.
